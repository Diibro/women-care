Pregnancy usually lasts about 40 weeks, or just over 9 months, as measured from the last menstrual period to delivery. Health care providers refer to three segments of pregnancy, called trimesters.",
               "Pregnancy is the period in which an egg cell is fertilized by a sperm to form a new cell, called the zygote, that eventually develops into a new human organism, to be born.   Pregnancy can be single or multiple. The latter refers to conceiving two or more fetuses at the same time or conceiving one zygote which divides into two or more separate zygotes at a very early stage of development and forms two fetuses.  If the former, fraternal twins, triplets, quadruplets or quintuplets are formed. If the latter, identical twins (or more multiples) are born as they have the same genetic makeup. While identical twins are fairly common, identical multiples of higher order are very rare."

               " Pregnancy symptoms differ from person to person and pregnancy to pregnancy. Some women might start to notice changes within the first week and some might not until they miss a period. The surest way to know you’re pregnant is to take a pregnancy test or contact your healthcare provider. Here are some common early signs of pregnancy: Missed period. If you’re in your childbearing years and a week or more has passed without the start of an expected menstrual cycle, you might be pregnant. However, this symptom can be misleading if you have an irregular menstrual cycle. Tender, swollen breasts. Early in pregnancy hormonal changes might make your breasts sensitive and sore. The discomfort will likely decrease after a few weeks as your body adjusts to hormonal changes. Nausea with or without vomiting. Morning sickness, which can occur at any time of the day or night, often begins in the first trimester. However, some women feel nausea earlier and some never experience it. Pregnancy hormones likely play a role. Increased urination. You might find yourself urinating more often than usual. The amount of blood in your body increases during pregnancy, causing your kidneys to process extra fluid that ends up in your bladder. Fatigue. Fatigue also ranks high among early symptoms of pregnancy. During early pregnancy, levels of the hormone progesterone soar – which might make you feel sleepy. It is important to note that several of these symptoms are not exclusive to pregnancy, and could indicate sickness or an upcoming period. You can also be pregnant without experiencing these symptoms. Still, if you miss a period and notice some of the above signs or symptoms, take a home pregnancy test or see your health care provider. If your home pregnancy test is positive, make an appointment with your health care provider."

This is an estimated due date based on the typical number of weeks of pregnancy and should not be used as an exact deadline for your baby to arrive.
